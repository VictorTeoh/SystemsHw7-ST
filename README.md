If the program hangs after printing "populating orig[] with 10 random numbers", just generate more entropy (i.e. move your mouse, click repeatedly, push buttons, etc.) until the program finishes. 

We could get around this issue by using /dev/urandom but like, we're not allowed cause apparently we need the extra encryption provided by dev/random ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
